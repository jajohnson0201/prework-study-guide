          <li>To add style to our webpage, we will use Cascading Style Sheets (CSS),
          which is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage
          content is presented to users. Whereas HTML strictly handles the structure
          and content of a webpage, CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout,
          and organization. We use CSS to define style rules for specific elements
          of an HTML page and format them using a wide range of style options.</li>
            <br> </br>
	        <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, 
	        internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.
	        ...</li>
	        <li>Inline CSS style- Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, 
	        using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. 
	        Theyre useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external 
	        and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually 
	        whenever you make a design change.
	        ...</li>
	        <li>Internal CSS style- contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. 
	        The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, 
	        which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code. 
	        Again, a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.
	        ...</li>	
	        <li>External CSS style sheet- This is preferred in most cases because it allows
 	        developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
            <br> </br>

            <li>IMPORTANT NOTE</li>
           <li>Separation of concerns is a widely used term in web development and refers to 
	        separating code into different files based on use. It is one of the key design 
	        principles that we practice in the boot camp. Separation of concerns is based 
	        on the idea that each section of code should have its own responsibility.</li>
	
          <br> </br>
          <li>Rules	</li>
	        <li>example css rule: div {color: blue; text-aline: justify}
           ...</li> 
            
           <li>selector(div)- defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.
	        ...</li>
	        <li>-Property(color/text-aline)</li>
	        <li>-Value(blue/justify)</li>

            <br> </br>
            <li> IMPORTANT NOTES</li>
            <li>-you can use multiple selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma,
	        this allows the declarations to affect both selectors, rather than repeating a rule.
          ...</li>
	        <li>-you can also use CLASS ATTRIBUTE as the selector, this is to add styles to certain elements,
	        but not ALL the elements, this allows sharing of a CSS RULE to any element we choose by assigning
	        the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. 
	        Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML.
	        ...</li>
	        <li>-Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to 
	        reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that 
	        need to be written or maintained. DRY can greatly reduce the overall size and 
	        complexity of a codebase.
	        ...</li>
	        <li>-Debugging is one of the most important parts of the development process. 
	        Every day, developers notice errors and review code that isnt working. 
	        Its important to get into the mindset that errors and mistakes are gifts. 
	        They tell us when something is wrong, and if we can stay curious, 
	        we can figure out what is happening and learn something new.
	        ...</li>
	        <li>-Assigning colors in CSS can be done in many ways, 
	        including by semantic references such as gray or blue. 
	        We can also refer to a color by its hexadecimal code, or hex #. 
	        Try selecting a color and replace the border color with its hex #	 </li>

            <br> </br>
            <li>SELECTORS:</li>
            <li>*(special wild card symbol)- Sometimes, we want to apply a rule to all the elements 
	        visible on the page. To do that, we use a special wild card symbol, or *. 
	        In this rule, we have declared that ALL of the elements on the page will have the 
	        style properties margin and padding set as the same amounts.
	        ...</li>
	        <li>card-     </li>
					 
          <br> </br>


	        <li>Properties:</li>
	        <li>declarations(color: blue/text-aline: justify)- contain two important components: 
	        the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.
	        ...</li>
	        <li>margin- property acts much like a margin in a word processing document.
	        A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. 
	        The margin is not visible on the page; it merely adds a buffer. When we set the 
	        margin property to 0, we are indicating that we want NO extra space around the element.
	        ...</li>
	        <li>padding- property is often confused withmargin, but it is not the same thing. 
	        The padding property adds space around the content inside an element. 
	        When you increase padding, you are actually making the entire element bigger! 
	        That is because the padding, while transparent, is located inside the element, 
	        whereas the margin is the transparent buffer outside an element.
	        ...</li>
	        <li>-To understand MARGIN AND PADDING better, it is important to know that every HTML element is 
	        essentially a box. Each box consists of margins outside the element, 
	        and the element's borders, padding, and content. 
	        This is sometimes referred to as the CSS box model. 
	        ...</li>
	        <li>text-align- This is one way to center a title or heading on a webpage.</li>
