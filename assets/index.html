          <li>To add style to our webpage, we will use Cascading Style Sheets (CSS),
          which is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage
          content is presented to users. Whereas HTML strictly handles the structure
          and content of a webpage, CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout,
          and organization. We use CSS to define style rules for specific elements
          of an HTML page and format them using a wide range of style options.</li>
            <br> </br>
	        <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, 
	        internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.
	        ...</li>
	        <li>Inline CSS style- Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, 
	        using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. 
	        Theyre useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external 
	        and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually 
	        whenever you make a design change.
	        ...</li>
	        <li>Internal CSS style- contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. 
	        The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, 
	        which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code. 
	        Again, a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.
	        ...</li>	
	        <li>External CSS style sheet- This is preferred in most cases because it allows
 	        developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
            <br> </br>

            <li>IMPORTANT NOTE</li>
           <li>Separation of concerns is a widely used term in web development and refers to 
	        separating code into different files based on use. It is one of the key design 
	        principles that we practice in the boot camp. Separation of concerns is based 
	        on the idea that each section of code should have its own responsibility.</li>
	
          <br> </br>
          <li>Rules	</li>
	        <li>example css rule: div {color: blue; text-aline: justify}
           ...</li> 
            
           <li>selector(div)- defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.
	        ...</li>
	        <li>-Property(color/text-aline)</li>
	        <li>-Value(blue/justify)</li>

            <br> </br>
            <li> IMPORTANT NOTES</li>
            <li>-you can use multiple selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma,
	        this allows the declarations to affect both selectors, rather than repeating a rule.
          ...</li>
	        <li>-you can also use CLASS ATTRIBUTE as the selector, this is to add styles to certain elements,
	        but not ALL the elements, this allows sharing of a CSS RULE to any element we choose by assigning
	        the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. 
	        Then the class attribute can be assigned to the element in the HTML.
	        ...</li>
	        <li>-Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a coding principle that encourages developers to 
	        reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that 
	        need to be written or maintained. DRY can greatly reduce the overall size and 
	        complexity of a codebase.
	        ...</li>
	        <li>-Debugging is one of the most important parts of the development process. 
	        Every day, developers notice errors and review code that isnt working. 
	        Its important to get into the mindset that errors and mistakes are gifts. 
	        They tell us when something is wrong, and if we can stay curious, 
	        we can figure out what is happening and learn something new.
	        ...</li>
	        <li>-Assigning colors in CSS can be done in many ways, 
	        including by semantic references such as gray or blue. 
	        We can also refer to a color by its hexadecimal code, or hex #. 
	        Try selecting a color and replace the border color with its hex #	 </li>

            <br> </br>
            <li>SELECTORS:</li>
            <li>*(special wild card symbol)- Sometimes, we want to apply a rule to all the elements 
	        visible on the page. To do that, we use a special wild card symbol, or *. 
	        In this rule, we have declared that ALL of the elements on the page will have the 
	        style properties margin and padding set as the same amounts.
	        ...</li>
	        <li>card-     </li>
					 
          <br> </br>


	        <li>Properties:</li>
	        <li>declarations(color: blue/text-aline: justify)- contain two important components: 
	        the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.
	        ...</li>
	        <li>margin- property acts much like a margin in a word processing document.
	        A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. 
	        The margin is not visible on the page; it merely adds a buffer. When we set the 
	        margin property to 0, we are indicating that we want NO extra space around the element.
	        ...</li>
	        <li>padding- property is often confused withmargin, but it is not the same thing. 
	        The padding property adds space around the content inside an element. 
	        When you increase padding, you are actually making the entire element bigger! 
	        That is because the padding, while transparent, is located inside the element, 
	        whereas the margin is the transparent buffer outside an element.
	        ...</li>
	        <li>-To understand MARGIN AND PADDING better, it is important to know that every HTML element is 
	        essentially a box. Each box consists of margins outside the element, 
	        and the element's borders, padding, and content. 
	        This is sometimes referred to as the CSS box model. 
	        ...</li>
	        <li>text-align- This is one way to center a title or heading on a webpage.</li>

        <li>JAVASCRIPT NOTES
          <br></br>
	        <li>what is javascript- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics
	        <li>javascript data types and data structures- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures
            <br></br>
            <li>example- var shape = "circle";
              <li>var- declare a variable, A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code
                <li>= - assignment operator, assign the specific data we want in our variable
                  <br></br>
                  <li>example- var topics = "HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript";
                    <li>string- ability to inlcude multiple variable topics, done by surronding string in quotation marks,
                      <li>and commas to add more topics to the string.
                        <br></br>
                        <li>example- console.log(topics);
                          <br></br>
                          <li>consol.log -We can use the console.log method to output a message to the web console 
	        by adding an argument. In this case, console.log will output the value of topics 
	        to the web console because we've added it as an argument inside the parentheses.
	        ...</li>
	        <li>closer look at console.log. The word console refers to a test environment that 
	        developers use to check out their code. The second part, .log(), is a method, 
	        which means a set of instructions that can be executed by a computer. 
	        The .log() method will output whatever we add inside the parentheses to the console.
	        ...</li>
          <li>The console.log method was created to make it easier for developers to test their code. 
          Developers use it daily to debug and test the code that they write. Soon, 
          using it will become second nature for you too!</li>
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          <li>IMPORTANT NOTES</li>
          <li>Control Flow- refers to order in which computers execute code in a script(top to bottom)
          the ORDER MATTERS</li>
          <li>-What exactly do we mean by “truthy” and “falsy” in Javascript? 
          A value is considered falsy if it is one of the following values: 
          0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false. 
          All other values, including a Boolean with the value of true, are considered truthy.</li>
          
          <li>-The strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal,
          and returns a Boolean result true if the values are equal and false if the values are not equal. </li>
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          <li>CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS/LOGIC</li>

          <li>example(1)-   Conditional: 
            <li> If (a plate is fancy) {
              <li> put it on the top shelf
              <li> } else if (a plate is plain) {
                <li>  put it on the bottom shelf
                  <li> }  else if (a plate is cracked) {
                    <li> put it in the trash
                      <li> } </li>
              <br></br>
          <li>example(2)-  
            <li>if (first condition) {
              <li>    // block of code to be executed if first condition is truthy
              <li> } else if (second condition) {
                <li>   // block of code to be executed if second condition is truthy
                  <li> } </li>
              <br></br>
              <li>example(3)-    
                <li>if (0) {
                  <li> console.log("I'm 0!")
                    <li> } else if (null) {
                      <li> console.log("I'm null!")
                        <li> } else if (true) {
                          <li>  console.log("I'm true!")
                            <li> }</li>
              <br></br>
              <li>if-code will only execute IF the statement meets a condition or is TRUTHY, if it is,
          then it will do whatever acftion we ask it to do in between the curly brackets.
          If the condition isnt true or has a value that isnt TRUTHY, 
          then the computer will ignore whatever is in between the curly brackets and move on</li>
          <br></br>
          <li>else if- if statement with more than one condition, 
          The computer will continue through all of the conditions that we list, 
          evaluating whether or not a condition is truthy. Once it finds a condition that is truthy, 
          it will run the code in the curly brackets associated with that condition, 
          and then break out of the if statement.</li>
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          <li>ARRAY	</li>
          <li>example- var shapes = ["triangle", "square", "pentagon", "circle"];</li>
          <br></br>
          <li>-To create an array, we declare a variable in the same way that we declared a variable 
          with only one data item. That is, we use var and then give the variable a name. 
          However, instead of assigning the variable to a single value, 
          we assign the variable to a group of values.</li>
          <br></br>
          <li>Important Note- Arrays are useful tools for storing multiple items with different data types 
          in a single variable, but not all arrays must have multiple data types. 
          The array that we will add to our project only contains strings.</li>
          <br></br>
          <li>-array index- To work with individual data items inside an array, 
          we need to have one more piece of information: the location of the data item in the array. 
          This location is identified with a unique number called an index. 
          Using each piece of data's index, or location number, we can access individual data inside the array.
          ...	</li>
          <br></br>
          <li>In JavaScript and many other programming languages, arrays are zero-indexed and sequential. 
          This means that the first item in any array has an index of 0, not 1. 
          The indices, or location identifiers, will always be whole numbers that increase by 1 each time.
          ...</li>
          <br></br>
          <li>array index example- ["triangle", "square", "pentagon", "circle"] 
                                       0,            1,         2,        3
          <li>var shapes = ["triangle", "square", "pentagon", "circle"];</li>
          <li>console.log(shapes[0]);</li>
<br></br>
<br></br>
<br></br>
          <li>LOOPS</li>
          <li>for- for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all 
          the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over. 
          Developers must use another statement, such as the conditional if statement that we just learned, 
          to interrupt the control flow by executing a block of code a specific number of times.</li>
          <br></br>
          <li>array length-The array length is important because the for loop needs to know how many 
          times the code will run until there are no items left in the array. 
          We can find the length of an array by using a built-in property of an array, 
          appropriately named length.
          ...</li>
          <br></br>
          <li> example of array loop- </li>
          <br></br>
            <li> 1.	var x = 0;</li>

              <li>statement 1- declare a variable (x), and give it a value of 0</li>
              <br></br>
                <li> 2.	x < shapes.length;</li>
          
                  <li>statement 2- this is the condition statement, 
          As long as the number in the variable x is less than the length of the array, 
          the loop will keep running. This will allow the loop to execute one time 
          for each item in the array. We use the length built-in array property on our 
          shapes array to express that condition, as shown.</li>
          <br></br>
          <li> 3.	x++</li>
          
            <li>statement 3- The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item. 
          Since indices follow a predictable pattern, we know the number increases by 1 each time. 
          The code x++ is a shortcut way of writing x+1. Now every time the code loops, 
          x will increase by 1, as shown.</li>
          <br></br>
          <li>and to put it all together it looks like-</li>

            <li>for(var x = 0; x < shapes.length; x++) { </li>
              <li>console.log(shapes[x]);
                <li> } </li>
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          <li>FUNCTION
            <li>A function is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not 
          automatically execute when the JavaScript file (in our case, script.js) is run. 
          Instead, you must call a function by name in order to execute it. 
          While that may seem like extra work, having a block of code that executes only 
          when we call it makes the code more easily reusable, 
          because we can call it as many times as we need. Being able to call a function to execute it 
          also means you can control where in the control flow a task is executed, or if it is executed at all.</li>
          <br></br>
          <li>Important Note- A function's name is followed by parentheses (). 
          Later on, we will define parameters that can be placed inside the parentheses. 
          For now, just remember that it is important to include the parentheses whenever you write a function.</li>
          
          <li>-functions are similar to if statements and for loops. 
          the code to be executed is written inside the curly brackets{}</li>
          <br></br>
          <li>Math-Helps to select a random number</li>
         <li> Math.floor() and Math.random() are both properties of JavaScript's 
          built-in Math object that can be used together to generate a random number.</li>
